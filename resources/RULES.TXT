This is a robot maze game.

Your goal is to flee from the robots that exist in the labyrinth until they die or to exit the maze.
Beware of electric fences and posts, you will get electrocuted if you touch them. So, you know... don't.
There are also non-electric posts which you can't crash into, but can be used to get robots stuck.
Each time you make a move, the robots also move, and they will always move towards you in the direction of the shortest path.
Use the:
-AWDX keys to move vertically and horizontally.
-QECZ keys to move diagonally.
-S key to stay in place.

If you get captured by one of the robots or touch the fences/posts, you lose.
If you escape the maze, you win.
Robots that collide with each other get destroyed/stuck, obstructing a cell that you can't move into.
With that said, good luck.
